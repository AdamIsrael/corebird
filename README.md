  - `f`  - favorite
  - `dd` - delete
  - `Return` - Show tweet details


## Will this work on distrubution XYZ?
  I don't know. If you can satisfy all the dependencies, probably yes but
  you'd most likely still have to compile and install it from source(that is,
  if no one else makes packages).


## But but... something is not right!
  Open a bug. Writing about it somewhere else(especially in a language I do not understand) won't help.
