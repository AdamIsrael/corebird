/**
 * MissingListEntry represents a list item in a stream to tell the
 * user that his connection to the Twitter server is interrupted.
 * It therefore saves 2 tweet ids, lower_id and upper_id(which can be
 * set once the connection has been established again) to save what
 * portion of the stream is lost.
 * It has 4 states:
 *  - interrupted: If the stream has been interrupted
 *  - resumed: If the stream was once interrupted but is not resumed
 *  - loading: If the user pressed 'load missing tweets' in
 *             the resumed state and we now load those
 *  - error: If anything went wrong at any point
